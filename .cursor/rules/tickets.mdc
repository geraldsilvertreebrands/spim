# Ticket System Rules

## Ticket References

When the user says any of these:
- "do ticket X-NNN"
- "implement X-NNN"
- "work on X-NNN"
- "start X-NNN"
- Just "X-NNN" (e.g., "A-003", "D-015")

You MUST:

1. Find and read the ticket from the correct file:
   - **A-001 to C-015**: Read from `PROJECT-TRACKER.md`
   - **D-001 to D-025**: Read from `PHASE-D-TICKETS.md`
   - **E-001 to F-010**: Read from `PHASE-E-F-TICKETS.md`

2. Announce: "Starting ticket X-NNN: [Title]"

3. List the acceptance criteria from the ticket

4. Implement step-by-step following the ticket's solution

5. After each significant change, run tests

6. When complete, verify ALL acceptance criteria

7. Announce: "Ticket X-NNN complete. All criteria met."

## Ticket Structure

Each ticket contains:

```markdown
## Ticket X-NNN: Title

### Summary
What needs to be done

### Current State (if applicable)
What's currently broken/missing

### Solution
Exact steps/code to implement

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2
- [ ] ...

### Priority: HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW
### Effort: X hours
### Status: NOT STARTED/IN PROGRESS/COMPLETED
```

## Phase Order

Phases MUST be completed in order:
```
A → B → C → D → E → F
```

Within a phase, tickets should generally be done in order (001, 002, 003...)
unless dependencies allow parallelization.

## Phase Completion

Before moving to next phase, ALL tickets in current phase must be:
- Status: COMPLETED
- All acceptance criteria checked off
- Full test suite passing

## Updating Ticket Status

When starting a ticket:
- Change `Status: NOT STARTED` to `Status: IN PROGRESS`

When completing a ticket:
- Change `Status: IN PROGRESS` to `Status: COMPLETED`
- Check all acceptance criteria boxes

## Current Phase Location

Check `PROJECT-TRACKER.md` for:
- Current phase
- Ticket completion status
- Phase completion checklists
